A JavaBean is just a standard. Below are the standards
    - All properties private (use getters/setters)
    - A public no-argument constructor
    - Implements Serializable.

    Java provides a mechanism, called object serialization where an object can be represented as a
    sequence of bytes that includes the object's data as well as information about the object's
    type and the types of data stored in the object.


Objective of this project :
    - Create a Java Bean (EmployeeBean)
    - Equivalent Groovy Bean (Employee)
    - Look at a Groovy Bean under the hood (Check compiled class)
    - How to use Groovy Beans
    - How to write your own getters / setters
    - Direct field access (check DoubleBean)
